# About Me

I'm a Research Associate at the Lahore University of Management Sciences.

My goal is to democratize Machine Learning systems, making them more efficient, generalizable, and robust to scenarios that they weren't explicitly trained for.

Some of my interests include:

- **Efficient ML**: Knowledge Distillation, Neural Network Pruning, Parameter-Efficient Finetuning

- **Domain Generalization**: Inductive Biases of Discriminative and Generative Models, OOD Detection, Representation Learning, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation

- **Cultural Biases and Fairness in AI**: Social Biases in LLMs, Safety Alignment, Culturally-Relevant Generative Modeling, Multilingual NLP

- **Interpretability**: Mechanistic Interpretability, Causal Learning, Similarity of Representations, Neural Network Circuits

You can find more details about my projects, relevant experiences (industry, research, and teaching), and activities outside academia in my [Resume](files/Resume.pdf).
