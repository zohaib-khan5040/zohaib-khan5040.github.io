# About Me

I'm currently working as a Research Associate, collaborating on projects at the Lahore University of Management Science and under the Fatima Fellowship.

My goal is to democratize Machine Learning systems, making them more efficient, robust, and safe

Broadly, I'm interested in Reasoning, Safety Alignment, and Efficient ML Systems.
