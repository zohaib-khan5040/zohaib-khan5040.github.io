# About Me

I'm currently working as a Research Associate, collaborating on projects at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, under the Fatima Fellowship, and at a stealth startup.

My goal is to democratize Machine Learning systems, making them more efficient, generalizable, and robust to scenarios that they weren't explicitly trained for.

Broadly, I'm interested in Efficient Machine Learning (particularly Knowledge Distillation and Parameter-Efficient Finetuning), Safety Alignment, and Domain Generalization. 

I'm working on breaking into Data Engineering and GPU Programming with CUDA. 

You can find more details in my [Resume](files/Resume.pdf).

I can do a double backflip but only when no one is looking.
